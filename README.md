This is a simple Node.js Express server that has two endpoints. 

The first endpoint is at / and returns a JSON object with a message. 

The second endpoint is at /e and returns a JSON object with an encoded number generated using the crypto module. 

The server is designed to be hosted on an EC2 instance and listens on the port specified in the process.env.PORT environment variable, or port 3000 if the environment variable is not set.
